Changelog of sdistmaker
=======================


1.4 (2010-03-19)
----------------

- Don't crash when setup.cfg contains dev-and-revisionmarkers. [WouterVH]


1.3 (2010-03-01)
----------------

- Added MANIFEST.in to get reliable releases with mercurial.  Sorry for
  messing up the 1.2 release and thanks to Maurits for pushing out a quick
  1.2.2.


1.2.2 (2010-02-26)
------------------

- Fixed broken release with missing TODO.txt.


1.2.1 (2010-02-25)
------------------

- Small documentation fixes.


1.2 (2010-02-25)
----------------

- **Renamed from tha.sdistmaker to sdistmaker**.

- Huge documentation improvement.

- Using optparse for the scripts so that they have a better usage message.
  This greatly improves documentation.

- Not showing the doctest from ``USAGE.txt`` anymore in the long description.
  That just wasn't readable documentation.

- The output directory is created when missing.


1.1 (2009-12-22)
----------------

- Documentation update.


1.0 (2009-12-21)
----------------

- Setup.py cleanup.


0.4 (2009-11-09)
----------------

- Replacing base and base_on_server the right way around, now.


0.2 (2009-11-09)
----------------

- Cleaning up the tempdir after we're finished with it.  And cd'ing out of
  that dir before zapping it.

- Using buildout's bin/python so that we get setuptools also when run on the
  server where there's no global setuptools.  This assumes we're always run
  within buildout: fine with me.


0.1 (2009-11-06)
----------------

- Added sdist_from_tags script for creating all tarballs.

- Added make_sdist script for creating a single sdist.

- Initial library skeleton created by thaskel.
