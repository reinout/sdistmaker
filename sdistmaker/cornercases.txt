Test setup tests and corner cases tests
=======================================

.. :doctest:
.. :setup: sdistmaker.tests.test_setup.setup
.. :teardown: sdistmaker.tests.test_setup.teardown


Nope, we don't want to mess up USAGE.txt with non-userfriendly test blather,
so we place that here.

Test setup
----------

"Pypi" directory for placing tarballs:

    >>> print pypidir
    PYPI

We did some monkeypatching to prevent real action from taking place:

    >>> import commands
    >>> commands.getstatusoutput('make tea')
    Command: make tea
    (0, '')

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.copy('a', 'b')
    Mock copy a -> b
